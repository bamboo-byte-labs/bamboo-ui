# Bamboo-ui

Bamboo-ui is a comprehensive UI component library designed and developed by Bamboo Byte Labs. It serves as the cornerstone for all websites and applications programmed by our company, ensuring a consistent and cohesive user experience across all our digital products.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Bamboo-ui is to provide a unified set of customizable and reusable UI components. These components are tailored to meet the design and functional requirements of our projects, promoting efficiency and maintainability in our development process.

## Technology Stack

Bamboo-ui leverages the following technologies:

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. Vue's component-based architecture is a perfect fit for our UI library.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that is faster and leaner than traditional tooling. It provides an optimized development and build process for our Vue components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and responsive UI development. Tailwind's highly customizable nature aligns perfectly with our design principles.
- **Radix Vue**: A set of unstyled, accessible UI components for building high-quality design systems and web applications. We utilize Radix Vue for ensuring our components are accessible and user-friendly.
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)**: A utility for managing complex component variants in a clean and type-safe way. CVA helps us handle different component states and styles efficiently.

By integrating these technologies, Bamboo-ui ensures a modern, efficient, and scalable approach to UI development, providing a robust foundation for all our web applications.

## Components

- Buttons
